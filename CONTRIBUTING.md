# Contributing to libadic

First off, thank you for considering contributing to libadic! It's people like you that make libadic a groundbreaking tool for mathematical research.

## üéØ Vision

libadic aims to be the definitive implementation of p-adic arithmetic for validating the Reid-Li Criterion. We value:

- **Mathematical Rigor**: Every algorithm must be mathematically correct
- **Performance**: Optimized for large-scale computations
- **Clarity**: Code should be self-documenting with clear intent
- **Testing**: Comprehensive validation with mathematical proofs

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/libadic.git
   cd libadic
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/originalowner/libadic.git
   ```

### Development Environment

We recommend using the Docker environment for consistency:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec libadic bash
```

## üîß Development Process

### 1. Create a Branch

Create a feature branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation improvements
- `perf/` - Performance improvements
- `test/` - Test improvements

### 2. Make Your Changes

#### Code Style Guidelines

- **C++ Standard**: Use C++17 features appropriately
- **Naming**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions/Methods: `snake_case`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - Member variables: `member_var_` (trailing underscore for private)
- **Headers**: Use include guards, not `#pragma once`
- **Memory**: RAII everywhere - no manual memory management
- **Errors**: Use exceptions for error handling

#### Mathematical Requirements

Every mathematical function must include:

1. **Convergence conditions** clearly documented
2. **Precision guarantees** explicitly stated
3. **Mathematical proof** or reference to literature
4. **Test cases** validating the mathematics

Example:
```cpp
/**
 * Computes the p-adic logarithm of x.
 * 
 * Mathematical basis: Taylor series log(1+u) = u - u¬≤/2 + u¬≥/3 - ...
 * Convergence: Requires x ‚â° 1 (mod p) for p ‚â† 2, or x ‚â° 1 (mod 4) for p = 2
 * Precision: Returns result with precision O(p^N) where N is input precision
 * 
 * Reference: Koblitz, "p-adic Numbers", Chapter 4
 * 
 * @param x p-adic number with valuation 0
 * @return p-adic logarithm of x
 * @throws domain_error if convergence conditions not met
 */
Qp log_p(const Qp& x);
```

### 3. Write Tests

Every contribution must include tests:

```cpp
void test_my_feature() {
    TestFramework test("My Feature Test");
    
    // Test the mathematical identity
    test.mathematical_proof(
        "Identity name",
        "Proof description",
        actual_value == expected_value
    );
    
    // Test edge cases
    test.assert_true(edge_case_handled, "Edge case description");
    
    // Validate precision
    test.assert_precision(computed, expected, tolerance, "Precision test");
    
    test.report();
    test.require_all_passed();
}
```

### 4. Update Documentation

- Update the README if you've added new features
- Add inline documentation for all public APIs
- Include mathematical proofs in comments
- Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add Iwasawa logarithm for p-adic L-functions

- Implement convergent series expansion
- Add Mahler coefficient computation
- Validate against Coleman's formula
- Test convergence for p=2,3,5,7"
```

Follow conventional commits:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation
- `perf:` - Performance improvement
- `test:` - Test addition/modification
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring

### 6. Run Tests

Before pushing, ensure all tests pass:

```bash
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
ctest --verbose
```

Verify mathematical correctness:
```bash
./milestone1_test 5 60
./milestone1_test 7 60
./milestone1_test 11 60
```

### 7. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- Clear description of changes
- Mathematical justification if applicable
- Test results
- Any benchmark improvements

## üìä Performance Contributions

When optimizing performance:

1. **Benchmark First**: Measure before and after
2. **Document Complexity**: State big-O complexity
3. **Maintain Accuracy**: Never sacrifice correctness for speed
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Include large-precision tests

Example benchmark format:
```cpp
// Benchmark: Computing log_p for 1000-digit precision
// Before: 2.3s
// After: 0.8s
// Method: Implemented binary splitting for series evaluation
```

## üî¨ Mathematical Contributions

For new mathematical algorithms:

1. **Provide Proof**: Include complete mathematical proof or citation
2. **Verify Convergence**: Document convergence conditions
3. **Test Exhaustively**: Multiple test cases across different primes
4. **Compare Literature**: Reference existing implementations
