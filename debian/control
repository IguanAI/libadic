Description: Development files for libadic
 libadic is a C++ library providing high-precision arithmetic in p-adic
 number fields. It implements:
  * p-adic integers (Zp) and numbers (Qp)
  * Morita's p-adic Gamma function
  * p-adic logarithm and special functions
  * Dirichlet characters and L-functions
  * Reid-Li criterion (unique implementation)
 .
 This package contains the development headers and static library.
